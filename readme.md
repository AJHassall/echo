# Echo: Real-time Desktop Audio Captions (Early Development)

**This project is a very early experiment and is unstable. Use with caution.**

Echo captures your computer's audio and creates real-time captions using a local AI model (Whisper).

**Current Status:**

* Captures desktop audio.
* Transcribes audio using a local Whisper model.
* Displays transcriptions in the console.

**Key Technologies:**

* Rust (for performance)
* Neon (Rust to JavaScript bridge)
* Electron (cross-platform desktop app)
* Whisper (local audio transcription)

**Planned Features:**

* Real-time caption overlay on the desktop.
* Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux).
* Improved stability and error handling.
* Better audio processing (noise reduction, etc.).
* User settings (audio device, language, caption style, model selection).
* Code improvements (remove static variables).
* Improved user interface.
* Speaker identification.
* Saving transcriptions.
