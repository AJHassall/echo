Echo (Early Development)

Capturing Desktop Audio and Generating Real-time Captions

This project is a very early-stage experiment to create a desktop application that captures audio from your system's audio output and transcribes it into real-time captions. It leverages the power of Rust for performance and Neon for bridging to JavaScript within an Electron application.


Please be aware that this project is in its initial stages of development.  Functionality is limited, and it is likely to have bugs and be unstable.  This is currently a proof-of-concept and is not yet intended for general use.

Key Technologies Used:

    Rust: The core logic, audio processing, and transcription are implemented in Rust for performance, memory safety, and concurrency.
    Neon: Neon is used to create a native Node.js module in Rust, allowing seamless integration with JavaScript and the Electron framework.
    Tokio: Tokio is a Rust runtime for asynchronous programming, enabling efficient handling of audio streams and background tasks like transcription.
    Electron: Electron provides the framework for building a cross-platform desktop application using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and integrating the Rust-based native module.
    Whisper Audio Transcription Model: This project utilizes a local Whisper model (e.g., ggml-tiny.en.bin) for offline audio transcription.

Current (Very Basic) Functionality:

    Captures audio input from the system's default audio output device.
    Processes audio in chunks.
    Performs audio transcription using a local Whisper model.
    Currently, transcriptions are logged to the console (JavaScript side).

Planned Features & Future Development:

This project is aiming to achieve the following features in future iterations:

    Real-time Caption Display: Display transcribed text in a user-friendly overlay window on the desktop in near real-time.
    Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensure the application works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux. This involves robust cross-compilation and handling platform-specific audio APIs.
    Improved Stability and Error Handling: Address current instability and implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application.
    Refined Audio Processing: Optimize audio capture, noise reduction, and voice activity detection (VAD) for better transcription accuracy.
    Configurable Settings: Allow users to customize settings such as:
        Audio input device selection.
        Transcription language.
        Caption display appearance (font, size, color, position).
        Whisper model selection (potentially supporting different model sizes for trade-offs between speed and accuracy).
    Remove Static Variables (Rust Code Refactoring): Refactor the Rust code to eliminate the use of static mutable variables for improved code structure, thread safety, and testability (as discussed during development).
    Enhanced User Interface: Develop a more feature-rich and user-friendly interface for controlling recording, displaying captions, and managing settings.
    Potential for Speaker Identification: Explore the possibility of incorporating speaker identification into the captions.
    Saving and Exporting Transcriptions: Allow users to save and export the generated transcription text.
